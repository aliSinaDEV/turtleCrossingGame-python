Turtle Crossing Game
Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This is a Python game built using the turtle library, where the objective is to help the turtle cross the road safely without getting hit by any cars.

How to Play
To start the game, run the main.py file in your Python environment. The turtle will start at the bottom of the screen, and cars will start moving from left to right on the road. Your goal is to help the turtle cross the road safely by using the arrow keys to move the turtle up, down, left, or right.

If the turtle collides with any cars, the game is over. However, if the turtle successfully crosses the road, the level increases and the game gets harder with more cars on the road. Your score is tracked throughout the game, and the high score is saved between game sessions.

Requirements
This game requires Python 3 and the turtle library to be installed on your system. You can install the turtle library using the following command:

python
Copy code
pip install turtle
